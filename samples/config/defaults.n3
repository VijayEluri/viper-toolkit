# Command line arguments and properties

## would like to be able to specify rules like:
#[	a lal:CommandLineTrigger ;
#	rdfs:label "file" ;
#	lal:abbr "f" ;
#	lal:var :file ;
#	lal:implies {
#		:mediator  lal:setProperty [
#			lal:propertyName "FileName" ;
#			lal:propertyValue :file ] } ] .
#
## This would convert "-f file.xml" into ":mediator lal:setProperty..."
## perhaps if we switch to jena2 or another rdf parser...
## I should be able to hack it together - a formula is a Model that
## implements RDFNode. Unfortunately, they can't be serialized to RDF/XML and
## are not part of the RDF M&S, which is wierd, since timbl uses them all
## the time. One would assume that he would have the final say on these
## sorts of things...

[	a lal:PreferenceFlag ;
	# This prints out the usage using the preferences format
	# Unfortunately, this means the full usage won't get printed
	# if the config file is not proper notation3.
	rdfs:label "help"@en ; 
	lal:abbr "h"@en ;
	rdfs:description "Print out this help message"@en ; 
	lal:invokes "edu.umd.cfar.lamp.apploader.prefs.PrintUsage" ] .

# Beans

# Basic application settings
# lal:Core is the only "bean" that is defined by default
lal:Core
	a lal:Bean ;

	lal:shellCommand "Usage: appLoader <options>"@en .
	# If a bean is in a frame or view, this is the name in the window pulldown
	# or the name of the frame. What sucks is there is no way to alter this
	# programmatically without events in the RDF model. 
	# But I want it to be part of the RDF for l10n reasons.
	# lal:nature "visible" ;
	# lal:setProperty [ lal:propertyName "layout" ; lal:propertyValue "mdi" ] ;
	# # other options could include "mac"(default) and "eclipse/docked" 


# Remaining Questions:
#  Tab order - would like to be able to tab from chronicle to canvas,
#              how to allow this?
#  other keystrokes
#  first focus - it might be good to have focus always 
#                start on another bean instead of the app window?
