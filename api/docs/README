ViPER Data API

The ViPER API provides programmatic access to data stored in a ViPER file. The 
API may be useful in a read-only sense, but this implementation includes
the ability to change the model directly. The basic, read-only functionality
is detailed in the viper.api package, while extended functionality, such as
modification and events, are detailed in the viper.api.extensions package.
