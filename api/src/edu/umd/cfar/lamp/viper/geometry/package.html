<p>A set of classes for manipulating geometric data, usually used
for {@link viper.descriptors.attributes ViPER attribute data}.</p>

<p>Included are classes for dealing with polygonal data, which inherit
from {@link viper.geometry.PolyList}. There are also some classes for
dealing with {@ling viper.geometry.Rasterable bitmap data}, but
that proved too slow and most of it has been deactivated. There is
also a class for dealing with {@link viper.geometry.Rational rational
numbers}, necessary for certain operations on polygons (notably,
intersection of lines).</p>
