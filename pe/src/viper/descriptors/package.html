<p> Provides the classes necessary to read comparable Descriptors in
from a file. </p>

<p> A {@link viper.descriptors.Descriptor Descriptor} is a description of some
action, event, object, state, etc. found in a video file. It
can be as simple as a boolean value and as complex as tracking
moving text in a bounding box as it changes color. This is
acomplished by specifiying {@link descriptors.attributes Attributes}. These
objects can then be compared to determine accuracy, or
<a href="#distance">distance</a>. </p>

<a name="distance"></a>
<p>Distance is defined as a measure of the difference between
two things, with certain desireable properties. Theseproperties are:
<UL>
  <li>Positiveness: If A != B, then dist(A,B)) &gt; 0.
       If A == B, then  dist(A,B) = 0. </li>
  <li>Symmetry: dist(A,B) = dist(B,A)</li>
  <li>Triangle Inequality:
       dist(A,C) &lt; dist(A,B) + dist(B,C)</li>
</UL>
The distances between Descriptors are all <em>bounded by 1</em>,
which means they are never greater than 1. </p>
