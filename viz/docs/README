#
# This code is used to make graphs from the .raw files produced by 
# the gtfC program.  
#


To run this code, 
   1) modify gtfc-graphics.config to set up local environements.
   2) make sure that your version of perl includes
	perl5.005_01
	Chart-0.99
	GD-1.19
   3) possibly modify the perl program bin/makegraph to point to the
	local version of perl

The Examples directories contains several .raw files that can be used
	to produce various graphs and several .config files which 
	make different types of graphs.
	

Each of the following graphs can be run from the Examples directory.
They rely on using the .raw file by the same name, and produce a
series of graphs.  For the first 3 individual .config files, 5 graphs
will be produce for each.  For the pixel run 3 graphs are produced.

The combined graph shows how all of the runs (dice, maxdev and
overlap, or news-desk-pixel and advertisement-pixel) can be shown on
one graph, and the append graph shows how those runs can be appended.

For Individual Graphs:

	makeGraph news-desk-dice.config
	makeGraph news-desk-maxdev.config 
	makeGraph news-desk-overlap.config
	makeGraph news-desk-pixel.config

For Graphs comparing all Runs:

	makeGraph news-desk-combined.config 
	makeGraph pixel-combined.config 

For Graphs appending all Runs:

	makeGraph news-desk-combined.config 

combineGraph can be used to make a single ps file from a set of .gif files.


NOTES:

1) In order for the pixel Frame Measure to work correctly, either the list
of source files must be included as in:

  SOURCEFILES = 1 nd-001_00001.jpg 	2  nd-002_00001.jpg 	...

where the pairs represent the frame number and the name of the file
respectivly, one pair for each frame, on a single line.

or a single line 

  NUMFRAMES = N 

where N is the number of frames in the Sequence or Frame List

Currently this information can be added manually during the ground
truth creation and will carry through to the evaluation.  This will be
changed in the next version of ViPER to be included automatically.
